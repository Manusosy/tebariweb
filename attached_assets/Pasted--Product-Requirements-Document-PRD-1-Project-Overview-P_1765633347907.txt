# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

**Product Name:** Tebari Plastic Hotspot Tracking System
**Phase:** Pilot / Demo-ready MVP
**Region Focus:** Kenya (Coastal regions first – Kilifi, Mtwapa, Watamu, etc.)

Tebari is building a **data-driven plastic waste intelligence platform** that enables real-time mapping of plastic waste hotspots, efficient coordination with recyclers, and transparent reporting for partners and funders.

This pilot system will be **fully functional**, suitable for **real-world pilot use**, while also acting as a **funding and investor demo**. It will later evolve into an enterprise-grade system (Django + DRF + Mobile App), but for now will be delivered as a **Vite + React web application** with strict role-based access.
